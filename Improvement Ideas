Some ways to improve game:

-Different Weapons Do Different Amounts of Damage
-Randomize the types of spawned monsters
-Randomize the order of monsters (make sure the dragon comes at the end!)

-Change the formatting of the printing of stats and asking what to do
-Automatically dodge?

-Fix the level up - it's awkward and seems useless
	-char and monster hp and xp and dmg adjusted for level
	-level up with more xp
	-monsters encountered have lvl within a certain range of your own

-combine with dungeon game to add movement and map
-combine with descriptions of surroundings for fun storytelling aspect
-add to the things I'll learn from web page development to run on a webpage instead of in the console.
